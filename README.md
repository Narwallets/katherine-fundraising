### **create_kickstarter**

To create a Kickstarter, Katherine admin must call:

```rust
fn create_kickstarter(
    name: String,
    slug: String,
    owner_id: String,
    open_timestamp: u64,
    close_timestamp: u64,

```rust
pub fn change_kickstarter_owner(
        kickstarter_id: u32,
        new_owner_id: String
    )
```

### **get_kickstarter_id_from_slug**

You could retreat the Kickstarter Id from the Kickstarter unique slug.

```rust
fn get_kickstarter_id_from_slug(slug: String) -> u32 
```

### **get_total_kickstarters**

Get the total number of Kickstarters, this value equals the maximum Kickstarter Id.

```rust
fn get_total_kickstarters() -> u32
```

### **get_kickstarters**

Get a list of Kickstarters starting from index `from_index`. See [get_kickstarter](https://github.com/Narwallets/katherine-fundraising/tree/main#get_kickstarter) to get the details of the `KickstarterJSON` response.

```rust
fn get_kickstarters(from_index: usize, limit: usize) -> Vec<KickstarterJSON>
```

### **get_kickstarter**

Get the simple information about the Kickstarter with the `KickstarterJSON` object. To get a more detailed view of the Kickstarter use [get_project_details](https://github.com/Narwallets/katherine-fundraising/tree/main#get_project_details).

```rust
fn get_kickstarter(kickstarter_id: u32) -> KickstarterJSON
```

The `KickstarterJSON` response:

```rust
struct KickstarterJSON {
    pub id: u32,
    pub total_supporters: u32,
    pub total_deposited: String,
    pub open_timestamp: u64,
    pub close_timestamp: u64,
    pub active: bool,
    pub successful: Option<bool>,
}

When an account send **stNear** for the first time to Katherine, a supporter is created.

The `"msg"` argument MUST be included with the `Kickstarter_id`. If the `msg` does not contain a valid `Kickstarter_id` the funds will be rejected and returned to the sending account.

```rust
fn ft_transfer_call(
    receiver_id: String,    // Katherine Contract Address
    amount: String,
    msg: String,
)
```

If the funds are being send by the Kickstarter, the **pTokens**, the tokens must be sent from the token address reported when the Kickstarter was created.

### **withdraw**

This function is for the Supporters to withdraw stNear. If it's called during the funding period, all the tokens could be withdraw. This same function works for stNear withdraw after the funds are unfreezed.

```rust
fn withdraw(amount: String, kickstarter_id: u32)
```

### **withdraw_all**

Same as [withdraw](https://github.com/Narwallets/katherine-fundraising/tree/main#withdraw), but automatically calculate all the available tokens for the user.

```rust
fn withdraw_all(kickstarter_id: u32)
```

### **get_active_projects**

This is a function destinated for the FRONTEND to call the active and open projects.

**Active** project are waiting for funding. **Open** projects are in funding period.

```rust
fn get_active_projects(
    from_index: u32,
    limit: u32,
) -> Option<ActiveKickstarterJSON>
```

If the returned value is `null` then the `from_index` value is larger than the total number of kickstarters.

### **get_project_details**

Get all the details from a particular Kickstarter.

```rust
fn get_project_details(kickstarter_id: u32) -> KickstarterDetailsJSON
```

The result is the `KickstarterDetailsJSON`:

```rust
struct KickstarterDetailsJSON {
    pub id: u32,
    pub total_supporters: u32,
    pub total_deposited: String,
    pub open_timestamp: u64,
    pub close_timestamp: u64,
    pub token_contract_address: String,
    pub stnear_price_at_freeze: Option<String>,
    pub stnear_price_at_unfreeze: Option<String>,
    pub goals: Vec<GoalJSON>,
    pub active: bool,
    pub successful: Option<bool>,
    pub winner_goal_id: Option<u8>,
    pub enough_reward_tokens: bool,
    pub available_reward_tokens: String,
}
```

### **get_supporter_total_deposit_in_kickstarter**

An **important** function to get the total amount that a supporter has deposited in an specific Kickstarter. If the Supporter is not part of the Kickstarter then the function will `panic`.

```rust
fn get_supporter_total_deposit_in_kickstarter(
    supporter_id: String,
    kickstarter_id: u32,
    st_near_price: Option<String>,  // This argument is optional to calculate an estimation while the stNEAR is freezed.
) -> String
```

### **get_kickstarters_to_process**

This is a view function for the **robot**. It returns a list of the successful and unsuccessful `Kickstarter Id`.

```rust
pub fn get_kickstarters_to_process(
    from_index: u32,
    limit: u32,
) -> Option<KickstarterStatusJSON>
```

The result could be `null`, this would mean that the maximum number of kickstarter has reached. The structure is:

```rust
pub struct KickstarterStatusJSON {
    pub successful: Vec<u32>,
    pub unsuccessful: Vec<u32>,
}
```

### **process_kickstarter**

This is a call function for the **robot**. It processes the successful and unsuccessful Kickstarters to **evaluate** if a Goal was reached or not.

```rust
fn process_kickstarter(kickstarter_id: u32)
```

### **get_kickstarters_to_unfreeze**

This is a view function for the **robot**. It returns a vector of `KickstarterId` that are ready to be unfreeze.

```rust
fn get_kickstarters_to_unfreeze(
        from_index: u32,
        limit: u32,
    ) -> Option<Vec<u32>>
```

### **unfreeze_kickstarter_funds**

After the `unfreeze_timestamp` date, any account should be able to unfreeze the stNear funds.

```rust
fn unfreeze_kickstarter_funds(kickstarter_id: u32)
```

### **kickstarter_withdraw_excedent**

Function for the Kickstarter. This function is used to withdraw all the **pTokens** that are not going to be delivered to the Supporters.

```rust
fn kickstarter_withdraw_excedent(kickstarter_id: u32)
```

### **get_supporter_estimated_stnear**

Get an estimation of the current amount of stnear that Katherine owns to the supporter. This is only available during the freezed period, after the funds are unfreezed the exact value could be calculated using the [get_supporter_total_deposit_in_kickstarter](https://github.com/Narwallets/katherine-fundraising/tree/main#get_supporter_total_deposit_in_kickstarter) function.

The returned value is a decreasing value, due to the appreciation of the stNear.

```rust
fn get_supporter_estimated_stnear(
    supporter_id: String,
    kickstarter_id: u32,
    st_near_price: String,
) -> String
```

### **get_supported_projects**

Get a list of the projects supported by the Supporter.

```rust
fn get_supported_projects(supporter_id: String) -> Vec<u32>
```

### **get_supported_detailed_list**

This function is for the Meta Yield Dashboard, in order to get the projects from `from_index` to `from_index + limit` which had receive support from the Supporter. The `SupporterDetailedJSON` must have all the required information of the Supporter investment. If the result is `null` then no more kickstarters are available.

The `supporter_deposit` and `deposit_in_near` represent the Supporter's value in **stNEAR** and **Near**, respectively.

```rust
fn get_supported_detailed_list(
    supporter_id: String,
    st_near_price: String,
    from_index: u32,
    limit: u32,
) -> Option<Vec<SupporterDetailedJSON>>
```

The result is:

```rust
struct SupporterDetailedJSON {
    pub kickstarter_id: u32,
    pub supporter_deposit: String,
    pub deposit_in_near: Option<BalanceJSON>,
    pub rewards: Option<BalanceJSON>,
    pub available_rewards: Option<BalanceJSON>,
    pub active: bool,
    pub successful: Option<bool>,
}
```

### **withdraw_stnear_interest**

    supporter_id: String,
    kickstarter_id: u32,
) -> Option<String>
```

### **get_supporter_available_rewards**

View the current available rewards for the Supporter to withdraw.

```rust
fn get_supporter_available_rewards(
    supporter_id: String,
    kickstarter_id: u32,

```rust
fn withdraw_katherine_fee(
    kickstarter_id: u32,
)
```

Contract Logic:

![Katherine Contract Logic](media/logic1.png)

The Ticket system:

![Ticket System](media/logic2.png)

## Important Assumptions

- Supporters after doing a deposit to a Kickstarter, could recover the funds before they get locked.
- Goal 1 gets all the stNEAR obtained if the Goal 2 is not met.

## Contract Functions

When a user deposits to fund a project, all of their stNEAR tokens are `ready_to_fund`.

- If the project is unsuccessful, fund are moved from `ready_to_fund` to `available`.
- If the project is successful, funds are moved from `ready_to_fund` to `locked`. When the locking period ends, fund are move backed from `locked` to `available`. Note that less stNEAR will move back, however the value in NEAR will be the same.


```text
create_project() - Kickstarter
deposit_and_stake() - User

user_withdrawa() - User
get_back_rewards() - Kickstarter
```
